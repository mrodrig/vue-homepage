        <h2>Welcome</h2>

        <p>
            Hi, I am currently enrolled in the Master's of Science in
            Information Assurance program at Northeastern University in Boston,
            Massachusetts. Some of the classes that I have already completed or
            am currently enrolled in include the following:

        </ul>

        <p>
            I graduated from Northeastern University in May, 2016 with my
            Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Information Science
            (Dual Major). While working towards my Bachelor's degree, I
            completed my first Co-op at EMC Corporation in August 2013. The next
            Co-Op that I will be able to go out on starts January, 2015 and ends
            in June, 2015. I was very excited to be able to work for a company
            and gain valuable experience. It was a great experience and I
            learned a lot at EMC. The initial job responsibilities include
            Time to Failure (TTF) testing on hard and solid state drives. When
            I noticed there was a possibility of improving the process utilized
            in running these tests, I explored those alternatives and presented
            my work to my co-workers. They were thoroughly impressed and
            eventually expanded my job responsibilities to include multiple
            additional programming responsibilities. If you would like to see
            some of the projects that I worked on at EMC, please look at my
            resume. It was a great experience to work for and be part of such
            an innovative company. For my second Co-op, I accepted an offer for
            my second Co-op at MITRE Corporation. I was able to learn a
            significant amount about AngularJS, NodeJS, Agile Software
            Development, and even lead my team's daily stand-up meetings.

I was inspired to write this due to a project requirement at MITRE that I could not find a good solution for. One of the key features that we needed was to be able to convert JSON documents that had nested documents. Existing modules did not support that functionality, and I wanted to avoid changing our data schema. In my spare time, I developed this module which allows us to easily convert our existing schema into a nicely formatted CSV output. I am hoping to continue to add more functionality to this module and possibly create additional node modules in the future.'
